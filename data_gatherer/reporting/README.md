# Reports

This directory contains report generators for analyzing OpenShift cluster data snapshots. Reports provide capacity analysis and workload configuration insights based on the current cluster state.

### Init Containers Exclusion (Change Note)

As of the init-container exclusion refactor (January 2025), the `container-capacity` report intentionally ignores init containers for all sizing and aggregation metrics. Earlier versions exposed dual aggregates (`main_*` vs `all_*`) plus an implicit init overhead. This proved confusing for runtime capacity planning because init containers do not consume resources after pod start completion. The report now surfaces only runtime (steady‑state) container resources:

* Removed aggregate keys: `all_cpu_raw`, `all_cpu_total`, `all_mem_raw`, `all_mem_total`, `all_cpu_lim_raw`, `all_cpu_lim_total`, `all_mem_lim_raw`, `all_mem_lim_total`.
* Removed HTML / Excel rows: "Totals (all containers incl. init)" and "Overhead (init containers)".
* Namespace totals tooltips and Excel comments explicitly state that init containers are discarded.

If you previously parsed these `all_*` fields, update your automation to rely on the `main_*` counterparts which now represent the sole authoritative values. This change is non‑configurable and uniformly applied to keep the model simple and aligned with real, sustained cluster pressure.

## Enhanced Worker Node Capacity Evaluation

All capacity reports (cluster-capacity, container-capacity, and containers-config) have been enhanced to provide accurate evaluation of resources available on worker nodes and consumed by workloads:

### Worker Node Identification
- **Enhanced Logic**: Worker nodes are identified using multiple methods:
  - Explicit 'worker' role label
  - Nodes without master/infra roles (to capture nodes with custom or missing role labels)
- This ensures all worker nodes are counted, even with non-standard labeling

### Workload Coverage
- **All Workload Types**: Includes Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, and DeploymentConfigs
- **DaemonSet Handling**: 
  - DaemonSets are correctly counted as running one pod per eligible worker node
  - DaemonSets targeting infra or master nodes (via nodeSelector) show 0 replicas for worker capacity
  - This applies to all three reports: cluster-capacity, container-capacity, and containers-config
- **Node Placement**: Workloads targeting master or infra nodes via nodeSelector are excluded from worker node calculations

### Resource Calculations
- **Allocatable Values**: Uses node allocatable resources (already accounts for system-reserved and eviction thresholds)
- **OpenShift Formula**: Allocatable = Capacity - system-reserved - eviction-thresholds
- **Replica Accuracy**: 
  - Properly handles zero-replica deployments
  - Scales DaemonSets per worker node count
  - Shows correct total resource consumption (per-pod × replicas)

### Report-Specific DaemonSet Display
- **cluster-capacity**: Shows aggregated totals per namespace including DaemonSet resources
- **container-capacity**: Shows per-container resources with replica count and total calculations
- **containers-config**: Shows replica count for capacity planning and configuration review

### Benefits
- More accurate capacity utilization percentages
- Better identification of worker node resource pressure
- Correct accounting for system daemons and infrastructure workloads
- Improved capacity planning insights across all reports

## Cell Formatting Rules

Reports apply a unified rules engine to highlight configuration quality issues. Each cell is evaluated against the active rule set and may receive one of the severity classes below.

### Severity & Visual Encoding
| Category | Style | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| ERROR_MISS | Red background | Required value or parameter is missing |
| WARNING_MISS | Yellow background | Recommended value or parameter is missing |
| ERROR_MISCONF | Red text | Wrong value or parameter set |
| WARNING_MISCONF | Orange text | Value or parameter set should be re-evaluated |

### Implemented Rules

Legend: 🟥 / 🔴 = error, 🟨 / 🟧 = warning (background-like vs text-like categories).

| # | Rule | Severity | Emoji |
|---|-------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Missing CPU request | ERROR_MISS | 🟥 |
| 2 | Missing Memory request | ERROR_MISS | 🟥 |
| 3 | Missing CPU limit | WARNING_MISS | 🟨 |
| 4 | Missing Memory limit | WARNING_MISS | 🟨 |
| 5 | Readiness probe missing / not configured | ERROR_MISS | 🟥 |
| 6 | ImagePullPolicy set to Always | WARNING_MISCONF | 🟧 |
| 7 | CPU or Memory requests value is lower or equal than 20% of its corresponding limits | WARNING_MISCONF | 🟧 |
| 8 | CPU limits value is higher than the total amount of CPUs of the smallest cluster worker node | ERROR_MISCONF | 🔴 |
| 9 | Memory limits value is higher than the total amount of RAM of the smallest cluster worker node | ERROR_MISCONF | 🔴 |

### Rule Implementation
Rules are defined in `rules/official_rules.py` and dispatched through the rules engine (`rules/engine.py`). The renderer applies the CSS class corresponding to the highest severity rule triggered for that cell.

## Usage

Reports are generated via the main CLI `report` subcommand. You can target one or many clusters.

### Report Command Output & Combination Rules

The `report` command now supports flexible combinations of `--all`, `--format`, and `--out`:

| Scenario | Example | Behavior |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Single cluster, single report, default format | `report --cluster prod --type summary` | Writes to `clusters/prod/reports/<prefix><timestamp>.html` |
| Single cluster, single report, explicit file | `report --cluster prod --type container-capacity --format excel --out /tmp/cc.xlsx` | Writes exactly to `/tmp/cc.xlsx` |
| Single cluster, all reports (HTML default) | `report --cluster prod --all` | Generates every registered type (one file per type) into `clusters/prod/reports/` |
| Single cluster, all reports, override format & custom dir | `report --cluster prod --all --format excel --out /tmp/prod-reports` | Creates directory if missing; one Excel per report type |
| Multi-cluster, single report | `report --cluster prod --cluster staging --type summary` | One file per cluster under each cluster's `reports/` dir |
| Multi-cluster, all reports to shared dir | `report --all-clusters --all --out /tmp/all-reports` | One file per (cluster,type) in given directory |
| Multi-cluster, format override | `report --all-clusters --all --format excel --out ./reports-all` | Forces Excel where supported; skips format override where not supported |

#### `--out` Semantics
* If multiple outputs will be produced (because of `--all` and/or multiple clusters), `--out` must point to a directory (it will be created if absent).
* If only one output will be produced, `--out` may be either a file path or a directory.
* When a directory is used for multiple outputs, filenames follow:
	` <prefix><report-type>-<cluster>-<timestamp>.<ext>`
	(Example: `summary-summary-prod-20250101T101500.html`)

#### `--format` Override
* Applies globally to all targeted report types for the invocation.
* If a report does not support the requested format, it falls back to its first supported format and logs a notice (the run continues).

#### Examples
Generate all reports for a single cluster into a custom directory in Excel:
```bash
python -m data_gatherer.run report --cluster prod --all --format excel --out ./excel-reports
```
Generate all reports for every configured cluster into a shared directory:
```bash
python -m data_gatherer.run report --all-clusters --all --out /tmp/all-reports
```
Single summary report for two clusters, forcing HTML into default per-cluster locations:
```bash
python -m data_gatherer.run report --cluster prod --cluster staging --type summary --format html
```
Explicit single output file path:
```bash
```

### Getting Help

Use the custom `help` command to list all available commands or get detailed help for a specific command:

```bash
# List all available commands
python -m data_gatherer.run help

# Show help for a specific command (e.g., report)
python -m data_gatherer.run help report
```
